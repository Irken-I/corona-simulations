In other words, the parameter value was mislabeled. We could have resolved this in a few different ways. For example, we could have simply labelled the parameter value correctly ('hospitalization rate, excluding people who eventually die'). That would have been awkward for end users. Instead, we chose to to keep the parameter label simple ('Hospitalization rate') and make the displayed value conform to that description. So the value displayed to end users is hospitalization_rate_excluding_fatalities + fatality_rate. You can verify this by moving the fatality rate slider; you will notice that the hospitalization rate changes as well.",
